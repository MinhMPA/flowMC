# Summary

`FlowMC` is a Python library for accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) building on top of `Jax` and `Flax`.


# Key features

- `FlowMC` by default employ gradient-based sampler such as Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA)
- Use of accelerators such as GPU and TPU are natively supported. The code also supports the use of multiple accelerators with SIMD parallelism.
- `FlowMC` provides an interface to train normalizing flow models using `Flax`.
- Gradient-based MCMC
- Accelerators
- Blackbox interfaces

# Statement of need

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.
